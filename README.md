## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 My name is John Matthew Mamaril, but people call me Matsu. I was born on September 21, 2002, and I currently live in Barangay San Antonio, Los BaÃ±os, Laguna.

I am a second-year student at Laguna State Polytechnic University â€“ Sta. Cruz Campus, taking up a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT).

In my free time, I enjoy playing computer games, performing in Battle of the Bands, and also playing basketball and football.

My main goal is to finish my degree and build a successful career in the field I've chosen.
